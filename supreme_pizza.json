How to Make a Supreme Pizza
Homemade pizza has never been so easy! Just read on for a basic overview of the steps!

Prepare dough and while it is rising, prep ingredients.
Top pizza with sauce, toppings and of course cheese.
Bake until bubbly and browned.
Let pizza sit about 10 minutes before slicing and serving, this keeps the cheese from sliding off.

PRO TIP: Before adding the oil to the prepared pizza dough, poke the surface of both crusts with a fork. This is called “docking” and prevents large bubbles from forming on the crust. It’s what professional pizzaiolos do!
